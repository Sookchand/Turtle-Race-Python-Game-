#  Turtle race Game{Python Game}
This code is a simple turtle racing game. 

First, it sets up a screen with a width of 500 and a height of 400. It then prompts the user to make a bet on which colored turtle they think will win the race.

Six turtles are created, each with a different color: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. They are positioned on the left side of the screen, with a vertical gap between them.

If the user makes a bet, the race begins. Each turtle moves forward a random distance between 0 and 10 in each iteration of the game loop.

The race ends when a turtle crosses the finish line (an x-coordinate of 230). If the winning turtle's color matches the user's bet, a winning message is printed. Otherwise, a losing message is printed.

Finally, the program waits for a mouse click to exit, allowing the user to see the final positions of the turtles before the window closes.

## Tech Stack
The technologies used in this code are:

1. Python, a high-level programming language,
2. Turtle module, a part of Python's standard library for creating basic graphics. The turtle module is often used for teaching programming concepts because it provides a simple and interactive way to create graphics. 
3. The random module, also a part of Python's standard library, is used to generate random numbers.
## Documentation
Here are some resources where you can find documentation for these technologies:

1. **Python**: Python's official documentation is comprehensive and constantly evolving. You can browse the docs online or download a copy of your own. It includes tutorials, guides, and more¬π. You can also refer to the Python 3.12.0 documentation¬≤ or the Python Tutorial on W3Schools¬≥.

2. **colorgram.py**: This is a Python library that lets you extract colors from images. The colorgram.py 1.2.0 documentation on PyPI provides a detailed explanation of how to use the library‚Å¥. You can also find more information on the GitHub page for colorgram.py‚Åµ.

3. **turtle**: The turtle library in Python provides a representation of a physical "turtle" that draws on a sheet of paper on the floor. The official Python 3.12.0 documentation provides detailed information about turtle graphics‚Å∏. You can also refer to the Beginner's Guide to Python Turtle on Real Python‚Åπ.

I hope these resources help you understand these technologies better!

## Lessons Learned
Developing this game can teach several important programming concepts:

1. **User Input**: The game prompts the user to make a bet, demonstrating how to get input from a user.

2. **Loops and Conditionals**: The game uses a while loop to keep the race going until a turtle crosses the finish line. It also uses if-else statements to check if the user's bet matches the winning turtle.

3. **Working with Lists**: The game creates a list of turtles and iterates over it, showing how to work with lists in Python.

4. **Object-Oriented Programming**: The game uses the Turtle class from the turtle module to create turtle objects, demonstrating the basics of object-oriented programming.

5. **Randomness**: The game uses the random module to make each turtle move a random distance, showing how to introduce randomness into a program.

6. **Basic Graphics**: The game uses the turtle module to create a simple graphical interface, demonstrating how to create and manipulate graphical objects in Python.
